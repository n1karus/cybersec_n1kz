### Monday (24/02/2020)

> Due to me being sick and feeling too weak I was unable to really do anything or go to class today. However despite that I started IppSec on youtube on all his HacktheBox tutorials on retired 
> boxes as well as his techniques. Staying in bed, I just watched his videos all day to see how he tackled boxes, his thought process and the techniques and tools he used. I was surprised while 
> watching his videos, as he seems pretty skilled in the area yet on the easy difficulty boxes he was still stuck on some parts or making mistakes making me realise that it is okay for me to take 
> my time and make mistakes as well. Listening and watching his thought process and how he tackles these boxes opened up an entire new world for me as well, as he looked at information that I 
> would have ignored and knew that they could be relevant or just rabbit holes from just looking at it. Today, even though I did not attend class or start the Traverxec box for this week's 
> deliverable, I still feel like I did sufficient work as I had taken the time to watch videos and learn more about penetration testing.

> Today, I was also added to a group chat with Tyrone, Dylan and Hayden to be a group for the showcase and we had decided to meet up on Tuesday to start working on our demo and presentation on the 
> deliverable we had done for Week 5: the OpenAdmin box.

### Tuesday (25/02/2020)

> Today I met up with my groupmates to start working on the presentation for the showcase. We spent most of today deciding on how we were going to split the presentation. I ended up being chosen 
> to talk about the three Big E's (Enumeration, Exploitation, Escalation) and was chosen to talk about Exploitation. We started an outline of how the presentation would go and how the pre-recorded 
> demonstration would go.

### Thursday (27/02/2020)

> Today was the day that we had to showcase our journey through the 6 weeks of Summer Studio and the deliverable we had completed for Week 5. However, it was left to just Hayden, Dylan and I 
> presenting as Tyrone ended up being very sick and unable to make it. Before the showcase had started our group decided during the set-up that we would start practicing our presentation and do a 
> couple of dry-runs. This allowed us to gain more confidence on what we were going to present about and get into the rhythm of how we were going to present in the showcase.
>

>
> Personally, I think the showcase went quite well overall however we did only get three people come to our stall. Even though we only had three guests come over to our stall, I think we were able 
> to tell them about our journey through the Summer Studio and how vital Cyber Security is in the modern world. We showed them a pre-recorded demonstration of us going from boot to getting root in 
> a box which simulates a real-world attack and the impacts it can have on the real-world, while showing them the skills and knowledge that we were able to grow and obtain through the course of 
> the Studio.

>
> Our third guest was someone who only had basic knowledge on linux but had no technical knowledge whatsoever like our first two guests. I felt like I was able to adjust the pace of the 
> presentation and demonstration and use laymen terms to help the guest understand what the presentation was about and why Cyber Security was such an important field in the real world. We were 
> able to teach him about different aspects of Cyber Security and its impacts and why we were happy with choosing to do this Summer Studio that helped us build a solid foundation to continue 
> learning on our own afterwards. I also was surprised that throughout the presentation to all three of our guests, I was able to do it without looking at or referencing a script at all. I did not 
> feel overly nervous and did not stutter or panic during the presentation at all and was able to adapt and casually converse with the guests. Thus, I had achieved one of my personal goals set in 
> my Reflection 3 (http://n1kz.me/posts/reflection-3/) on being able to smoothly present by the end of the studio!

### Saturday (29/02/2020)

> I had tried working on Traverxec yesterday (Friday 28/02/2020) however I had caught Tyrone's sickness and was unable to focus properly or do anything. So I decided to allocate the whole of 
> Saturday after getting a day of rest on just doing the Traverxec box for my Week 6 deliverable along with its write-up. While doing the box, I ended up going into a call with Dylan and Hayden 
> once again on discord incase any help was needed as Dylan was still doing the box but Hayden had completed it.
>

>
> I continued the process of doing the write-up for the box as I was trying to hack the box, which after a few weeks of doing it, really did help me with both my write-up skills and technical skills. As I had mentioned in my Reflection 4 (n1kz.me/posts/reflection-4) about how this new method had allowed me to focus more on what I was doing and why I was doing something. Before I had joined this studio, I did not even know about the existence of write-ups and I was definitely not the type of person to do a journal type of thing like a write-up. But throughout this studio I have learnt to appreciate the existence of write-ups and how they catalogue your experiences, techniques and journey as you complete a CTF or a box and allow you to re-affirm the process and why you did such things.

>
> After completing this weeks deliverable I was satisfied with the work I had put in and was pleased with my progress throughout this studio. From having little-to-no technical skill to being able 
> to complete an easy level box in a day. I found that doing these types of challenges are important as they teach you different ways of being able to go from boot to root and that it is important 
> to learn how to Enumerate, Exploit and Escalate. 
>
> However, after I had completed my write-up and got root on Traverxec I decided to go through all my goals, strengths and weaknesses I highlighted in all the previous reflections to see what I had
> achieved and how far I had truly progressed. Although I had come a long way and had grown alot in technical skill and built a solid foundation, I had not achieved some of the goals I had set out. 
> Namely, in my Reflection 2 and 3, I had set the goals of progressing through the wargames of BANDIT and NATAS to help build my foundational skills nad knowledge in web pentesting and linux skills. 
> But from then on, I had not touched either of the wargames and had completely forgot as I continued to set out new goals and try out the new things as the studio had progressed. Thus, I hope to 
> actually make time to come back to these wargames and try to reach the goal I had setout in eventually completing it by doing it over the course of Semester 1 when it starts. This means in terms 
> of making my goals and keeping track of them I had not sufficiently worked on it as I forget the earlier goals I had set and focus on the newer ones. To fix this, I decided to begin making 
> reminders and list all the goals I set out and try to make time to complete them even if its only one hour every so often. My final goal that I want to set out for this studio however, is to 
> never forget the foundations that this Studio had helped me build and to continue to work on it. Whether that be through continuing to do the boxes that are on HacktheBox or going back to the 
> wargames. I want to continue to do this type of pentesting and work externally throughout the years and hopefully be capable enough to try for certifications and finally get a career in the 
> Cyber Security industry.
