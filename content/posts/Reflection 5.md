### Monday (17/02/2020)

> In the Monday class in Week 5 I came into class and was immediately given the deliverable for today which was to try and make an account for [hackthebox.eu](http://hackthebox.eu). 
> You are only able to make an account and access the site if you complete the Invite Challenge so I immediately began looking through all the HTML code on the website to see if I could see 
> anything suspicious.
>

>
> I was able to do it mostly by myself besides at the end due to some syntax issues which the tutor Jason had helped me with. I was able to be one of the first few to complete the challenge in the 
> class and that had left me feeling very satisfied as I felt like I have grown severely in my ability to find clues in web applications and etc. I learnt how to use tools such as Postman and 
> learnt more about sending HTTP requests such as POST and etc. However I did not end up doing a write-up for the Invite Challenge as I felt like it was not appropriate. 
>

>
> We were then given the deliverable for this week which was to perform one of the easy level boxes and get at least the first flag (user.txt) and do another write-up for it. I was super keen to 
> begin doing it as the whole of last year I had been meaning to start trying to do hackthebox due to hearing it from people in the Cyber Security Society at UTS. However I never got around to it 
> and felt my technical skill was lacking back then. With the skills I had learnt over the course of the Summer Studio, I began to feel more confident however and chose the OpenAdmin box to 
> complete for the deliverable. I began doing the OpenAdmin box however only completed the initial stages of finding out the ports open and what directories were on the machine before I had to 
> stop working on it. 

### Tuesday (18/02/2020)

> As today was my only proper free day I had set it aside to just fully work on the box. However due to severe personal circumstances arising Monday night, I was unable to focus or find the 
> motivation to complete the box. I had ended up spending the whole day trying to get my mind off things and finding the motivation to do the box from 10am to 8pm however made little to no 
> progress until I had given up. I knew that the work I did today was completely insufficient but due to me not being able to focus I decided to take a break. But I did not want my whole day to be 
> a waste and I had remembered the feedback given to me in Submission 3 as seen in Figure 3 below:
>
> ![Reflection%205/Reflection5SS3.png](/images/Reflection5SS3.png) **Figure 3: Feedback for Week 4 Reflection**
>
> But instead of reflections I had looked at the write-ups I had done to further re-affirm the processes to take during the phases of pentesting and how I had approached things or maybe approached 
> things differently. 

### Wednesday (19/02/2020)

> I still was not feeling motivated today and decided to communicate it with the tutor Jason about my motivation problems due to stuff going on in my life and we agreed to talk more in detail in 
> our one on ones on Thursday. However as I was not in the right state of mind I messaged him over messenger rather than Teams chat because I wanted a more personal chat.
>

>
> I was feeling very negative as I had made no progress on the box which was something that I have been wanting to learn and complete but was just unable to do it. I had also told my friends in 
> the Studio about how I have been feeling for the week and they had given me support and let me know that they were there to help me with the box and anything if I needed it which I really 
> appreciate. 

### Thursday (20/02/2020)

> I came early in the morning today to make sure I was prepared for the industry guest speakers coming in today from Deloitte. I had found out that they were Penetration Testers at Deloitte right 
> now which was what I was interested in doing however unluckily my Summer internship was for the client-side consultancy of Cyber Security. 
>

>
> They had taught us about what Penetration Testing had actually entailed and quoted: 
>
>"Penetration testing is a legal and authorised attempt to locate and successfully exploit ~~computer~~ systems for the purpose of making those systems more secure."
>
> They taught me that Penetration Testing did not just involve the cyber systems like the ones we had been playing with but also systems on a physical level such as hardware and even through 
> humans such as social engineering. I had found their talks about how pentesting works, the different ways to do it and the tools used very fascinating and felt some of the motivation that I had 
> not felt for the entire week sprout again. 
>
> ![Reflection%205/Reflection5SS5.png](/images/Reflection5SS5.png) **Figure 5: Photo of what Cyber Attack & Response teams do**
>
> Afterwards we began to do a box that Deloitte had prepared for us however I did not get far into it before giving up as I still felt mostly, a lack of motivation. I knew that still, the work I 
> was putting in was insufficient however I did not know what to do to deal with it.
>
> As the Deloitte Guest talk was ending, Hayden had asked them more about the human threat and how they dealt with it if asked. Nathan had replied with:
> 
> **"There are alot of ways data can leak out through employees, and ultimately there will always be a degree of human threat whether it be carelessness or on purpose to confidential information".**  
> Nathan had talked about the different methodologies to try and minimise the risk of human threat such as doing educational programs for employees on how to prevent it or just "scraping through 
> git and keep on checking on all information leaks through social media etc". 
>
> Then afterwards, I had my 'one on ones' with Larry and Jason where I had told them about what was going on in my life, how I had no motivation to do the box even though I wanted to and how I 
> have done little to no work over the past week. They had tried to encouraged me and told me to once again look over my past reflections to see how far I have come since week 1 as I had made a 
> lot of progress and it would be a shame to stop just before the end. To help me out they also pointed me in the right direction but overall gave me positive feedback and told me I was doing well 
> and have been in the right direction which made me settle a short-term goal of trying to complete the OpenAdmin box after work on Friday and continue with it on Saturday.

### Friday (21/02/2020)

> After work I decided to begin doing my OpenAdmin box as I finally felt some motivation in trying to do it. I started it over from the beginning to try and re-affirm the knowledge and complete 
> the box again from start to finish. Just like for my UA: Literally Vulnerable writeup (n1kz.me/posts/ua-literally-vulnerable), I decided to do the write-up as I did the actual box to help me 
> learn about the approach and actually time to think and reflect on each action I do.
>

> **OpenAdmin Write-up:** [n1kz.me/posts/openadmin](http://n1kz.me/posts/openadmin) 
>
> While working on the box for the entire night, I had decided to go onto a discord that we had made for our Summer Studio class and go into call with Hayden and Dylan just in case I needed any 
> help with the actual box.
>
> ![Reflection%205/Reflection5SS7.png](/images/Reflection5SS7.png) **Figure 7: Discord Call with Rulbeek (Hayden) and Teechan (Dylan)**
>
> They had assisted me in times I needed help by only giving me hints to generally point me in the right direction. I really appreciated their way of helping me as it actually allowed me to 
> contemplate what I was doing as I added it to my write-up and actually learn and figure out the steps I need to take myself. Tonight I felt like I made significant progress on my box and worked 
> sufficiently in trying to achieve my short-term goal of completing the OpenAdmin box. However I went to sleep at 2am just shy of getting the user.txt flag for the box and decided to finish off 
> the box on Saturday.

### Saturday (22/02/2020)

> I woke up early in the morning and continued to work on the box to try and finish it off as I was told by Hayden and Dylan that I was right near the end. After trying out tools and following the 
> three E's of Enumeration, Exploitation and Escalation, I had finally finished the OpenAdmin box by escalating myself to become a root user. I had felt extremely satisfied with myself that I was 
> able to complete a hackthebox with only some help in the form of hints from my friends and not looking at a write-up for the box. Looking back at my previous reflections such as Reflection 4, 
> I realised that I was able to complete one of my goals of completing a box without using a write-up for guidance. I remembered Jason's advice of looking back at my previous reflections and to 
> look at my progress and saw how much I had grown since Week 1 of the studio. From having minimal knowledge and not having broken or played around to any boxes before to finally rooting my first 
> box on hackthebox, I feel like I have progressed significantly and worked hard to get where I currently am. 
>
> When I went to tell Jason that I was able to finish the box, he had given me a tip and to try something I had not even known about or thought of before.
>
> ![Reflection%205/Reflection5SS8.png](/images/Reflection5SS8.png) **Figure 8: Messenger chatlogs with Jason on what to try**
>
> So I decided to try on getting an interactive shell as a proper root user and looked at [https://gtfobins.github.io/](https://gtfobins.github.io/) which seems like a very handy resource on how 
> different linux commands can be exploited or used. I was able to get a shell and was further reminded that there are several different ways of getting root and there is no one way of penetrating 
> a box.
