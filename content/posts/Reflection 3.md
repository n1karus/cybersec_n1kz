### Monday (3/02/2020)

>We were given the deliverable for our third week which was another presentation but this time on Web Application Penetration. However we were told that it had to be done with three people instead of four and the presentation was 6 minutes long. This week I had teamed up with David and Matthew and we chose Cross-site Scripting (XSS) as our topic. As David and Matthew had no idea what XSS had entailed so I gave them a brief explanation and showed them a small site: [https://xss-game.appspot.com/](https://xss-game.appspot.com/). I completed the first 6 levels and showed them as a small demo. We decided on using Microsoft Teams as our formal medium of communication for this presentation and Google Slides as the platform to collaborate on.

>After David made the group chat I went ahead and typed up a small message with all the points/tasks we need to do for the presentation. I asked both David and Matthew which one they wanted to do 
> and allocated them the points they would be working on and presenting about for Thursday. Due to my experience of not having managed time well enough for last weeks presentation and not 
> communicating enough with the team, I organised us to have a call on Wednesday night to talk over our presentation and practice it to nail it down.
>
>Afterwards the tutors introduced us to the topic of Web Application Testing and provided us with a bunch of quality resources to help us understand and try it out. We were given an instance of the Owasp Juice Shop to allow everyone in class to test for web vulnerabilities as different teams. I started it out by trying to log into the admin account with an SQL injection which netted me the completion of the first challenge on this instance as seen in **Figure 2**.

>
> For the rest of the day, I continued on with the Owasp Juice Shop and focused on finishing up the 1-star challenges. One that I had particular difficulty with was the one to 
> "retrieve the photo of Bjoern's cat". I could not figure out how to do it at all until I began googling and figured out that you cannot have "#" in a URL as it counts as HTML anchors. 
> Thus to fix it, I looked up the HTML encoding for "#", which was "%23" and replaced all the hashtags in the HTML to finally fix the image, which I found was the hardest challenge of today.

>
> Today, I felt like I had achieved and learnt a lot about Web Application Penetration. I did a couple of tutorials and did quite a few challenges in OWASP, leading me to believe that I had done a sufficient amount of work today.

### Tuesday (4/02/2020)

> As family issues and other commitments ended up popping up on my only free day of the week, I was unable to do as much as I wanted to today. I had planned to spend the whole day doing work on my 
> presentation, wargames and continue on OWASP juice but only was able to work on researching how XSS worked by using sites such as https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting and 
> https://www.hacksplaining.com which were both resources recommended on Monday. Due to these real life commitments, my work such as external research and wargames at home were insufficient
> and I realised that I would probably not be able to work on things for a long period of time for a while. Thus I have decided to try and work on time management as it always has been a 
> weakness of mine. I decided to set a goal of setting at least 1 hour of research or working on wargames whenever I can rather than setting the unrealistic expectations of being able to work on 
> it all day but then get interrupted by other commitments. 

### Wednesday (5/02/2020)

> After I had work, due to my extreme fascination about Web App Penetration and platforms such as OWASP that allowed me to play around with web vulnerabilities freely, I decided to invest my free 
> time in continuing to do the challenges on OWASP. 
>
> ![Reflection3SS4.png](/images/Reflection3SS4.png) **Figure 4: List of OWASP 1 & 2 Star challenges**
>
> As seen in **Figure 4** above I had lost track of time and completed most of the 1-2 Star challenges. Ones that were solved by my teammates, I re-did it on my own to make sure I was able to do it. Overall I had a lot of fun with playing around in OWASP and finding a range of web vulnerabilities and I definitely want to learn more in this field and will ask Jason in Thursday's class more about it. I definitely feel like I need to do more work in the field and figure out if this is something I want to actually delve deeply into.
>
> Afterwards, I began to polish up on my slides and make a script for what I was going to say during the presentation. I asked our group chat on Teams if we still wanted to call tonight to do last 
> minute preparation, review and practice to which David said he was up for it. However, Matthew was unable to be contacted and did not end up showing up for our call. David and I had a 30 minute 
> call where we had a mock presentation to see how much time we had, reviewed all the slides and did a final polishing. Since for last week's presentation, my team was cut off and unable to finish 
> our presentation, I made sure to drill in and practice with David to ensure we had enough time to present and did it succinctly.

> Due to how my performance went in last week's deliverable, I continued to practice my script before I went to bed. I wanted to try and achieve the goal I set in not being too nervous while 
> presenting and be more confident. Even though I have a script on my phone ready, I want to try and speak without looking at the script too much and make eye-contact, which was one of the 
> feedback provided by Larry and Jason in our one on ones to improve my presentation skills.

### Thursday (6/02/2020)

>Our deliverable for this week was due, and before we presented David, Matthew and I began to do another mock presentation to see if we managed the time well due to Matthew's absence from our 
> meeting last night. Having the practice presentation end with time to spare made me appreciate how important time management is in presentations and that practicing them is crucial. I made sure 
> to remind David to introduce all of us in the presentation as that was one of the feedback given to me from last week. Compared to last week I felt a lot more prepared, organised and felt like we
> had worked sufficiently on the presentation. 
>
> When we went up to present, everything was going smoothly and we managed to end the presentation with plenty of time to spare, while using all the feedback given to us by Larry and Jason such as 
> making more eye contact, engaging with the audience and using a loud and clear voice. However, I was still unable to hit my personal goal of being able to confidently speak in front of everyone 
> as when I tried to go off-script for an extended amount of time, I ended up stuttering and making mistakes. 
>
> I feel like with the extra practice sessions and having sufficiently prepared, I had improved significantly over last week's presentation. However, I still need to work on my weakness of personal execution of the presentation in front of an audience. To improve and work on the weakness, I plan to practice presentations more and have set an overall goal of trying to smoothly do a presentation by the end of the studio.

> Afterwards we were left to our own devices where I started to learn how to install and use BurpSuite. Anthony Pejkovic showed me how to set it up using the Kali VM. I began testing it out on the 
> VM to see how it is used and what its used for. After that I then began reading the resource provided by Jason to guide us on Web App Penetration.

### Saturday (08/02/2020)

> As I was finally free in the morning, I began to do the OvertheWire wargame for Web App Penetration, NATAS. I completed Natas0 to Natas4 before I had to hop off. 
> Please refer to [n1kz.me/posts/Natas-Logs](http://n1kz.me/posts/Natas_Logs) for my progress between these levels.
