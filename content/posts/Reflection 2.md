## Tuesday (28/01/2020)
> We were given our deliverable for week 2 which consisted of doing a group presentation about a reconnaissance tool and the presentation was due Thursday. 
> Dylan, Hayden, Lachlan and I instantly formed a group as most of us were already friends and Lachlan was sitting next to us and we chose Nmap as the tool we would present about. 
> We created a group chat for the presentation group on Microsoft Teams to organise what points need to be brought up and share the Trello link to organise how we were going about presenting, 
> as seen in Figure 1 below.

> As Hayden, Dylan and I were inexperienced with Trello we were hesitant on how to use it but luckily Lachlan had experience in using it. He set up the template pretty quickly and added 
> labels as well as instructions to make it an easier experience for the rest of us in using Trello. In the second figure down below is our Trello board and allocating the tasks that each of us 
> had to do for the presentation.

>After organising the initial Trello board we had guest speakers come attend our tutorial and first was **Patrick Kelso**. He had talked about all the things you could do with Linux and how it was 
> prevalent in the Cyber Security industry. However, I feel like I should have paid more attention to the mini tutorial Patrick did on Linux. I did not really pay attention and should have as 
> knowing all the tips and tricks of Linux feels beneficial as it can help a lot in the scope of cyber security. Currently, I only have a really basic knowledge on using Linux and right now am 
> seriously contemplating on using Linux on one of my PCs to help develop my ability in utilising Linux. 
>
>Afterwards we had **Robert Mitchell** another guest speaker who is a Security Engineering Manager at Gitlab come in and talk to us about the IT security history, hacking culture and real-world 
> experience in the cyber security field.  He had brought up multiple interesting incidents but one's that caught my eye were the "Gen 1 - Virus wars" which consisted of "Melissa" and "ILOVEYOU" 
> which caused respectively, $80M estimated damage and $5-8 billion worth of damage . **These viruses cause massive economic damage past and present, as people are unaware of these
> attacks done through social engineering to influence the person to trust and click links and files sent through emails. People less adept with technology need a clear understanding on the types 
> of emails and links that are to be trusted to avoid them being affected and causing data breaches due to human error** **(Problem statement for SLO 1)**. 
> To combat this, companies, schools and the government should be spreading awareness about the dangers on the internet and especially about the viruses that malicious people can send through 
> the mail in the form of attached files or embedded scripts. This will help reduce the amount of people that will fall for these type of emails that rely on social engineering 
> and human error/trust to cause a data breach or get hold of someone's computer.
>
>Due to all these attacks being made and causing massive economical damage, protocols and actions started being made to restrict the way information moved around, highlighting how these several cyber attacks have influenced and impacted the cyber world. In particular, Rob's presentation about all these real-world cyber attacks and the history of IT security was really interesting and helped broaden my knowledge about the cyber security field, and I will research all the incidents he had told us about in further detail hopefully by next sprint.

## Wednesday (29/01/2020)
> I did not get to attend the drop in session due to work however afterwards I had started on my part of the presentation. I began by communicating with my team using the Microsoft Teams chat function where we organised a call and check up after we did our parts as seen in Figure 3.
>
> ![Reflection2SS3.png](/images/Reflection2SS3.png) **Figure 3: Microsoft Teams chat about calling**
>
>So from about 3pm to 6pm I had spent my whole time researching about the type of information that Nmap can gather as that was my allocated part. I had found an excellent resource which was a free online book called "The Official Nmap Project Guide to Network Discovery and Security Scanning" by Gordon "Fyodor Lyon" ([http://nmap.org/book/](http://nmap.org/book/)). I began to read about all the different functions and ways that Nmap could gather information and also why you are meant to do it. This was a refreshing read as I had previously used Nmap for the UTS subject Cyber Security but we were never taught about how really a function works or why we use it, which I was now finally learning or understanding by trying to learn about Nmap for our presentation. I think in terms of my research and self-fulfillment on knowledge about Nmap I had worked sufficiently and I can definitely continue to improve on my knowledge about Nmap by continuing to read the book and using the software on a VM or my home network to become more adept in using it.
>
>Afterwards my team member Lachlan Brown brought up on Teams that we have not really been utilising the Trello board at all as some people did not put their allocated tasks up. We began discussing this issue on teams and came to the conclusion that even though it is an amazing tool,  Microsoft Teams (chatting and calling) as well as meeting in real life were more than sufficient to allocate tasks and prepare the presentation as seen in Figure 4. 
>
> ![Reflection2SS4.png](/images/Reflection2SS4.png) **Figure 4: Teams chat discussing why we did not end up using Trello**
>
>This was due to Hayden, Dylan and I not having sufficient experience with Trello and for a short term project such as this presentation, the time and effort to learn and use Trello would have been more detrimental, however for the future I definitely plan to learn and use Trello more as I did say before, it seemed to be an excellent tool for team and task management.

## Thursday (30/01/2020)
> In this tutorial our deliverable for this week was due. We went up to do our 4 minute presentation but ended up being cut off as we all took too much time. The main issue that we seemed to have with our presentation was time management. We should have  practiced over the call we had on Wednesday night and discussed how we were going to split up the times rather than leave it all to the last minute prep time we had on Thursday morning. We also did not discuss about introducing each other at the start of the presentation which was a point brought up by Larry. At first I thought the point brought up by Larry was trivial as everyone knew each other in Summer Studio but then Larry told us about how not everyone is going to know you at your future presentations. This made me realise that although my team did discuss problems and meet up frequently, we were still under-prepared and focused on working on the presentations content and not sufficiently on the actual presentation itself.
>
>Afterwards we were presented with a bunch of wargames and Capture the Flags (CTFs) that we would work on for the rest of the day before we did our one on ones. Due to me wanting to develop my linux-based skills Jason recommended that I do the Bandit Wargame by overthewire ([http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit)) which was aimed at absolute beginners and helps teach you the basics for other wargames. I had set myself to reach the goal of level 20 by the end of the Summer Studio as the tutors had said that you have set yourself a solid foundation if you can reach level 20. However during today I only finished level 0-1 as I had tried to update my Kali which ended up taking the duration of the lesson as I was not able to find a solution to copy and paste from VM to my local machine. 
>
>At the end of the tutorial, I had my one on one (well one on two) with Larry and Jason. They had given me lots of feedback and we talked about where I am at right now and what I want out of lessons. They gave me lots of feedback such as doing more critical self-evaluation in my reflections, make a more readable website (which I have corrected with this weeks reflection), make more eye contact and engage with audience during presentations and how to hit the SLOs required in my reflections. After telling Larry and Jason about how I wanted to do more technical stuff like wargames and how I enjoyed researching about Nmap, Jason had recommended me to do the wargames/CTFs that require using Nmap to find all the flags which I plan to start doing when I am free (which will probably be next week as I am pretty busy this week.)

## Friday (31/01/2020)
>After work I decided to continue on with doing Bandit. As per Jason's suggestion I started to make a blog post that followed my Bandit progress and how I completed each level or what resources I used to figure out how to do it as seen in the image below.
>
> ![Reflection2SS5.png](/images/Reflection2SS5.png) **Figure 5: My Bandit Logs in Notion**
>
> As the only real Linux experience I had was in a first year IT subject called Web Systems, I went through it slowly and took my time on how to do it, why I use each command and found proper documents online to help me when I was having trouble. I only ended up getting to level 5-6 before I had to stop. The link to my blog on my Bandit progress is here: www.n1kz.me/posts/bandit-logs

## Saturday (1/02/2020)
>I realised that the files for my website differed on my home desktop and my laptop due to working on my laptop in class and my desktop when I am at home. Thus, I began to play around with git again to pull and push files to have both my laptop and desktop fully update with the correct files that were in my GitHub repository. However when I had tried to pull the files from the repo to my laptop I was given the error:
>
	fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories.
>
>Afterwards when I tried pushing again I was given the error message:

	! [rejected] master -> master (non-fast-forward)
	error: failed to push some refs to [remote repo]
	hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
	hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
	hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
	hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details. 

> I was scared to mess with the GitHub repo any longer in case I ended up breaking the entire repository, thus I began to look online to which I found a case exactly similar to mine on the GitHub Community Forums ([https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/How-to-deal-with-quot-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories-quot/m-p/16305#M5000](https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/How-to-deal-with-quot-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories-quot/m-p/16305#M5000)). After looking at the solution and using the command

	git fetch origin
	git pull --allow-unrelated-histories

> My laptop began pulling the files and was up to date. I used code snippets as I closed PowerShell before I took screenshots.
