## Who Am I?

> My name is **Nicholas Zay** (ID: 13209477), and I am currently a 3rd Year student studying a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at University of Technology Sydney (UTS).
Currently, I do not have a career in the field of IT but I am aspiring to work in the field in the future, specifically in the Cyber Security industry. However as of now, I'm unsure what specific
area of Cyber Security I want to deeply study or work in.

## Where I currently stand in terms of Cyber Security

> Before the Summer Studio took place I have had a minimal exposure to the field of Cyber Security. I have participated in a few beginner Capture the Flags (CTFs) such as PicoCTF, as well as frequented
the events that the Cyber Security Society had held last year. Other than that the only other exposure I really have had is the networking (CCNA) and security subjects from UTS. However I am excited
for 2020 as it is going to be a year full of learning as I am going to be be exposed to real-world security practices in this Summer Studio, going to be doing subjects at UTS that have been rated
really highly by friends such as Digital Forensics and I am going to be completing a Summer internship at Deloitte in November for Cyber Security!  

## Summer Studio 2020
+ # My motivations for choosing this studio:
> The reason that I chose this studio was that I wanted to begin learning practical knowledge about the world of cyber security but had no idea where to start.
 I had achieved very little in terms of technical skills and foundational knowledge within the cyber security industry and wanted to be more active on how I was learning.
 After joining the Cyber Security Society and going to their events I was informed by previous students about how the society was running their own Summer Studio subject.
 They explained how the studio was a really practical learning experience that exposes you to real-world security practices and enables students to learn industry relevant skills and
 foundational knowledge needed for a career in cyber security. 

+ # Objectives in taking this studio
> + Become confident in being able to work in a collaborative project-based environment
> + Be confident and capable enough to take certifications such as OSCP
> + Build a strong foundation in technical skills and knowledge after this Studio so I am able to more actively learn more complex stuff on my own
> + By the end of this studio, have a blog detailing all my challenges and achievements in the IT field
