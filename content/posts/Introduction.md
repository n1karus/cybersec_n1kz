## My career plan
>I have achieved very little so far in terms of the Cyber Security industry besides the very basics of PicoCTF and networking/security subjects at UTS. I hope to be more active and learn more about this area and currently have a summer internship lined up at Deloitte in Strategy and Governance for cyber security which I am excited about. From there I hope to break in and experience more in the Cyber Security industry.

## My motivation
>The reason that I chose this studio was that I wanted to begin learning practical and useful knowledge about the world of cyber security but had no idea on where to start. I have been told by previous students that this subject is one of the best in teaching you the essential skills for the cyber security industry which gave me the last push to make the decision. By the end of this studio I hope to have enough knowledge to be able to have a solid foundation in pentesting and cyber security skills that I can continue to build upon.
