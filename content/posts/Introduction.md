## Summer Studio 2020
+ # My motivations for choosing this studio:
> The reason that I chose this studio was that I wanted to begin learning practical knowledge about the world of cyber security but had no idea where to start.
 I had achieved very little in terms of technical skills and foundational knowledge within the cyber security industry and wanted to be more active on how I was learning.
 After joining the Cyber Security Society and going to their events I was informed by previous students about how the society was running their own Summer Studio subject.
 They explained how the studio was a really practical learning experience that exposes you to real-world security practices and enables students to learn industry relevant skills and
 foundational knowledge needed for a career in cyber security.
