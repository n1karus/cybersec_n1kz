> Problem 1

+ Netlify was not able to deploy the website as seen in the error below where the Hugo version was conflicting and outdated on netlify and the theme I was using.

> Solution 1

+ To fix this error, I asked Dylan Tchan, a fellow student in the Summer Studio for help as he encountered the same problem and after researching for a bit changed the environment variables for 
building/deploying the domain by setting the hugo version to the current version I was actually using.

> Error 2

+ While trying to change the landing page of my static site through Hugo, I encountered an error where my sites formatting and styling broke completely, only leaving a cached version of the site as seen in the screenshot below.

> Solution 2

+ After going through the code, and through researching documentations from Hugo and stack overflow, I had figured out that you are unable to change the landing page of a Hugo site unless you edited the theme or created your own.
 To fix the problem I was having was pretty easy as I was only changing one line which is highlighted in the screenshot below.
